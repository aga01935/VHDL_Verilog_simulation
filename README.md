# VHDL_Verilog_simulation
## This will contain some examples of VHDL and Verilog simulation created

<ul>
<li> testbench.v contains the testbench framework for the simulation   <\li>
<li>  DES_40.v creates serializer block with 40 MHz sampling<\li>
<li> DES_160.v is copy of DES_40.v for 160 MHz sampling <\li>
<li> sim.do is just a script to compile and run the simulation <\li>


</ul>
